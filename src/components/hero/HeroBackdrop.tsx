/**
 * The photograph the hero is built on.
 *
 * Full bleed from `lg` up, and a deliberate band across the top below it, where
 * a picture behind six lines of type is a picture nobody can see. A portrait
 * tablet takes the band too: fitting the type beside the couple needs a frame
 * that is wider than it is tall, and 768×1024 is not that. The frame is zoomed a
 * little past `cover` and anchored off-centre, which does two things at once: it
 * weights the couple to the right of the composition, and it leaves the parallax
 * layer room to move without ever exposing an edge.
 *
 * Everything over it is a scrim. The diagonal takes the left side almost to
 * black so the headline has somewhere to live, the bottom gradient joins the
 * hero to the ink below it without a seam, and the vignette closes the corners.
 * All three are `aria-hidden`; the photograph itself keeps its description.

          the type is set on stays near-black, and the wash has finished fading by
          the time it reaches the couple, so neither face is veiled.

          Two of them, because the type block does not scale with the viewport
          the way the photograph does: the pill, the play circle and the
          twelve-pixel label are fixed sizes, so the row of actions reaches about
          half way across a 1024 frame and only a third of the way across a wide
          one. The narrow laptops therefore get a dark field that holds on some
          fifty pixels longer. They are separate elements rather than two
          `background-image` utilities on one, because utilities that set the same
          property resolve by stylesheet order, not by the order written here. */}
