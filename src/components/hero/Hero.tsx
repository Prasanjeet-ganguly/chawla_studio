/**
 * The opening frame: one photograph, a left-hand column of type, and three
 * pieces of marginalia along the bottom.
 *
 * Everything over the photograph is plain DOM — selectable, searchable,
 * translatable — and the only motion at rest is a few pixels of parallax on a
 * fine pointer. Below `lg` the composition is rearranged rather than scaled: the
 * photograph becomes a band across the top and the type stacks beneath it, which
 * is the one layout where a picture behind six lines of text is still a picture.
